## 📌 Day Overview

**Day 05** focused on mastering **digit manipulation in numbers**, a foundational skill in DSA that appears frequently in:

* Palindrome problems
* Reverse number problems
* Digit-based math logic
* Interview warm-up questions

Instead of relying on strings, all problems were solved using **pure mathematical operations**, which is the preferred approach in interviews.

---

## 🎯 Questions Solved

1. Count the number of digits in a number
2. Check whether a number is a palindrome
3. Reverse the digits of an integer

---

## 🧠 Core Concepts Used

* Modulus operator (`%`) to extract last digit
* Division (`/`) to remove last digit
* Loop-based digit traversal
* Mathematical utility methods from `Math`

---

## 🔑 Important Math Methods to Remember

* `Math.floor()` → rounds down
* `Math.ceil()` → rounds up
* `Math.round()` → rounds to nearest integer
* `Math.abs()` → converts number to positive

These methods are crucial when working with **numbers instead of strings**.

---

## 🔍 Digit Manipulation Logic (Key Insight)

```text
Last digit    → n % 10
Remove digit  → n / 10
```

This logic forms the **base of almost all digit-related DSA problems**.

---

## ⚠️ Common Mistakes to Avoid

* Converting numbers to strings unnecessarily
* Forgetting to handle negative numbers
* Not using `Math.floor()` while removing digits
* Missing edge cases like `0` or single-digit numbers

---


## ✅ Day Outcome

By the end of Day 05:

* Digit traversal logic became clear
* Confidence with math-based solutions improved
* Strong foundation built for advanced number problems

---

📌 **Here are some extra questions, if you want then please solve it will strengthen your concept more:**

* Armstrong number
* Sum of digits
* Product of digits
* Palindrome variations
