## 🧩 Problems Solved

This folder contains multiple **star and number pattern problems**, all solved using **nested loops**.

Patterns include:

* Square star patterns
* Right-angled triangle patterns
* Increasing & decreasing number patterns
* Repeated number patterns
* Binary (0–1) patterns

---

## 🧠 Pattern-Solving Strategy

Before coding any pattern:

1. Count the **number of rows**
2. Observe **elements per row**
3. Identify what changes:

   * Stars vs numbers
   * Increment / decrement
   * Repetition or sequence

Always dry-run patterns on paper first.

---

## 🔁 Core Pattern Logic

* **Outer loop** → rows
* **Inner loop** → values printed per row
* Conditions decide:

  * What to print
  * How many times to print

Once this is clear, most patterns become predictable.

---

## ❌ Common Pitfalls

* Writing separate logic for every pattern
* Ignoring loop boundaries
* Forgetting line breaks
* Over complicating simple patterns

---


## 🧪 Interview Tips

* Explain pattern in words before coding
* Mention row–column relationship clearly
* Start with simple pattern, then generalize

Interviewers often check **thinking clarity** here.

## ✅ Key Takeaway

> If you understand nested loops well, **half of beginner DSA is already solved**.
