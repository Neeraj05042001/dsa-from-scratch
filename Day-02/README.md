# Day 02 – Problems (Arrays Basics)

This folder contains the problems solved on **Day 02** of my DSA-from-scratch journey.  
The focus for today was **understanding arrays**, **iterating over them**, and **building basic problem-solving logic** without using any advanced methods.

## 📌 Problems Solved

### 1️⃣ Search an Element in an Array

**Problem:**  
Write a function that searches for a given element in an array and returns its index.  
If the element is not present, return `-1`.

**Concepts Used:**

- Array traversal
- Conditional checks
- Linear search logic

---

### 2️⃣ Count Negative Numbers in an Array

**Problem:**  
Write a function that returns the count of negative numbers present in an array.

**Concepts Used:**

- Loops
- Condition-based counting
- Basic number comparison

---

### 3️⃣ Find the Largest Number in an Array

**Problem:**  
Write a function that returns the largest number from a given array.

**Concepts Used:**

- Maintaining a maximum value
- Iterative comparison
- Initialization logic

---

### 4️⃣ Find the Smallest Number in an Array

**Problem:**  
Write a function that returns the smallest number from a given array.

**Concepts Used:**

- Maintaining a minimum value
- Iterative comparison
- Understanding edge cases

---

## 🧠 Key Learnings

- How to traverse arrays using loops
- How to compare and update values while iterating
- Importance of initialization when finding min/max
- Writing clean and readable logic without shortcuts

---

## 🎯 Focus for This Day

- Logic building over optimization
- Understanding the **why** behind each step
- Avoiding built-in helper methods to strengthen fundamentals

---

🛠 All problems are implemented using **JavaScript** and executed via **Node.js** using `console.log()` for output.
