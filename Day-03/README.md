</div>


## 📌 Topic Overview

On **Day 03**, the focus was on solving a classic array problem: **finding the second largest element in an array**.

Although the problem looks simple, it is extremely important from a **DSA fundamentals and interview perspective** because it tests:

* Array traversal
* Conditional logic
* Edge case handling
* Understanding of comparisons and value tracking

This problem was solved using **arrays, loops, functions, and iterators** without using any built-in sorting methods.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Given an array of numbers, find the **second largest distinct element**.

---

## 🧠 Key Concepts Used

* Array traversal using loops
* Tracking values using variables
* Conditional updates
* Handling edge cases properly
* Use of `Infinity` and `-Infinity`

---

## ⚠️ Corner Cases Considered (Very Important)

The solution carefully handles real-world edge cases:

1. **Empty array**
   → Not enough elements to find the second largest

2. **Array with only one element**
   → Second largest does not exist

3. **Negative numbers**
   → Works correctly because comparison logic does not assume positive values

4. **Duplicate numbers**
   → Ensures the second largest is a *distinct* value

## 💡 Approach Explained (Step-by-Step)






## ✅ Key Takeaways

* Simple-looking problems often test **deep fundamentals**
* Always think about **edge cases before coding**
* Tracking values is often better than sorting

---

📌 **Next Step Suggestion:**
Try variations like:

* Third largest element
* Kth largest element
* Second smallest element
