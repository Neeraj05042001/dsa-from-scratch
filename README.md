This repository documents my **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) journey from absolute scratch**, with a strong focus on **problem-solving, fundamentals, and consistency**.

I am learning DSA step by step and pushing **day-wise code and learnings** to this repository.  
This journey is inspired by my previous JavaScript learning series, where consistency and public accountability helped me grow significantly.
